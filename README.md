# CV Application Creator

[Here is a link to a live version of this site on GitHub Pages](https://tylershanks.github.io/cv-application/)

### What tools were used?

This project was created using React, Javascript, HTML, CSS, JSON, and webpack. 

### Why did you build this project?

This project was a part of The Odin Project's Fullstack Javascript curriculum.

This app shows the strengths of a React application very well. It was challenging to learn how to manage and properly edit the state. After understanding it better, I can see how useful state and React as a whole can be in any kind of application.

For this application, there are 2 arrays and 1 object in state. The object is for the personal information, and the 2 arrays are for the work experience entries as well as the education entries. The arrays hold individual objects of each work/education entry and are displayed on the right hand side. They are displayed in a way in which someone may set up their CV. It auto updates based on the state, which in turn is edited by the user in the input fields on the left hand side.

### What problem does it solve?

After being used as a learning tool, I have since used it as a refernece in future projects. I switched to using functional components more often than the class based components in this project, but the core concepts displayed here can be translated to many other projects.
