## CV Application

CV Creator project from The Odin Project.

This project was created using React, Javascript, HTML, CSS, JSON, and webpack. 

This app is very basic in functionality, however it shows the strengths of a React application very well. It was challenging to learn how to manage end properly edit the state. I was able to figure it out and I can see how useful state and React as a whole can be in any kind of application.
