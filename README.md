## CV Application

CV Creator project from The Odin Project.

This project was created using React, Javascript, HTML, CSS, JSON, and webpack. 

This app is very basic in functionality, however it shows the strengths of a React application very well. It was challenging to learn how to manage and properly edit the state. I was able to figure it out and I can see how useful state and React as a whole can be in any kind of application.

For this application, there are 2 arrays and 1 object in state. The object is for the personal information, and the 2 arrays are for the work experience entries as well as the education entries. The arrays hold individual objects of each work/education entry and are displayed on the right hand side. They are displayed in a way in which someone may set up their CV. It auto updates based on the state, which in turn is edited by the user in the input fields on the left hand side.
